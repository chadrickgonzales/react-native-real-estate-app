## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script
```bash
node setup-appwrite.js
```
This will guide you through configuring your Appwrite project.

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to your [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Navigate to **Storage**
3. Create a new bucket with these settings:
   - **Name**: `property-images`
   - **File Size Limit**: `10MB`
   - **Allowed Extensions**: `jpg, jpeg, png, webp`
   - **Encryption**: Enabled

### Step 3: Set Bucket Permissions
- **Create**: `users` (authenticated users can upload)
- **Read**: `any` (anyone can view images)
- **Update**: `users` (users can update their own images)
- **Delete**: `users` (users can delete their own images)

### Step 4: Update Properties Collection
Add these attributes to your Properties collection:
- `image` (String, 500 chars, not required)
- `images` (String, 2000 chars, not required)

### Step 5: Set Collection Permissions
- **Create**: `users` (authenticated users can create properties)
- **Read**: `any` (anyone can view properties)
- **Update**: `users` (users can update their own properties)
- **Delete**: `users` (users can delete their own properties)

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Option 1: Use the Test Component
Add this to any screen to test your setup:
```tsx
import AppwriteTest from '@/components/AppwriteTest';

// In your component
<AppwriteTest />
```

### Option 2: Test in Console
```javascript
import { testAppwriteSetup } from '@/lib/appwrite';

// Run this in your app
testAppwriteSetup();
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file contains:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROPERTIES_COLLECTION_ID=your_properties_collection_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID=your_users_collection_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your_bucket_id
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Bucket not found" error**
   - ✅ Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID` is correct
   - ✅ Check bucket exists in Appwrite console

2. **"Permission denied" error**
   - ✅ Verify bucket permissions are set correctly
   - ✅ Ensure user is authenticated

3. **Images not displaying**

   - ✅ Verify bucket has "Read: any" permission

4. **Upload fails**
   - ✅ Check file size limits (max 10MB)
   - ✅ Verify allowed file extensions
   - ✅ Check network connectivity

### Debug Steps:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
