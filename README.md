# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the database (see [Scripts Directory](./scripts/README.md))

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node setup-appwrite.js
   node setup-saved-collections.js
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## 📁 Scripts Directory

All setup, migration, and testing scripts are organized in the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory. See the [Scripts README](./scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation of each script.

### Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# Initial database setup
cd scripts
node setup-appwrite.js
node setup-saved-collections.js

# Test the notification system
node test-notifications-comprehensive.js
node verify-notifications.js
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
